Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer’s disease.",10.1038/s41586-019-1195-2,5/1/19,Prefrontal cortex,Human,,

Integrating transcription factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer’s disease risk loci revealed drivers of cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer’s disease.

While the transcriptome profile of microglia directs microglial functions, how the microglial transcriptome can be regulated to alleviate AD pathology is largely unknown. Here, we show that injection of interleukin (IL)-33 in an AD transgenic mouse model ameliorates Aβ pathology by reprogramming microglial epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles to induce a microglial subpopulation with enhanced phagocytic activity. These IL-33-responsive microglia (IL-33RMs) express a distinct transcriptome signature that is highlighted by increased major histocompatibility complex class II genes and restored homeostatic signature genes. IL-33-induced remodeling of chromatin accessibility and PU.1 transcription factor binding at the signature genes of IL-33RM control their transcriptome reprogramming. Specifically, disrupting PU.1-DNA interaction abolishes the microglial state transition and Aβ clearance that is induced by IL-33. Thus, we define a PU.1-dependent transcriptional pathway that drives the IL-33-induced functional state transition of microglia, resulting in enhanced Aβ clearance.",10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107530,4/21/20,Other/combined,Mouse,,

The R47H variant of human TREM2 impairs ligand binding and increases Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. In mouse models of amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation, defective TREM2 function affects microglial response to Aβ plaques, exacerbating tissue damage, whereas TREM2 overexpression attenuates pathology. Thus, AD may benefit from TREM2 activation. Here, we examined the impact of an anti-human TREM2 agonistic mAb, AL002c, in a mouse AD model expressing either the common variant (CV) or the R47H variant of TREM2. Single-cell RNA-seq of microglia after acute systemic administration of AL002c showed induction of proliferation in both CV- and R47H-transgenic mice. Prolonged administration of AL002c reduced filamentous plaques and neurite dystrophy, impacted behavior, and tempered microglial inflammatory response. We further showed that a variant of AL002c is safe and well tolerated in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial and engages TREM2 based on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. We conclude that AL002 is a promising candidate for AD therapy.",10.1084/jem.20200785,6/24/20,Whole brain,Mouse,,

In this study, we report that depletion of NK cells, a type of innate lymphocytes, alleviates neuroinflammation, stimulates neurogenesis, and improves cognitive function in a triple-transgenic Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse model. NK cells in the brains of triple-transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD) mice exhibited an enhanced proinflammatory profile. Depletion of NK cells by anti-NK1.1 Abs drastically improved cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice. NK cell depletion did not affect amyloid β concentrations but enhanced neurogenesis and reduced neuroinflammation. Notably, in 3xTg-AD mice depleted of NK cells, microglia demonstrated a homeostatic-like morphology, decreased proliferative response and reduced expression of neurodestructive proinflammatory cytokines. Together, our results suggest a proinflammatory role for NK cells in 3xTg-AD mice and indicate that targeting NK cells might unlock novel strategies to combat AD.",10.4049/jimmunol.2000037,7/15/20,Whole brain,Mouse,,

A comprehensive investigation of cell type-specific responses and cellular heterogeneity in AD is required to provide precise molecular and cellular targets for therapeutic development. Accordingly, we perform single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of 169,496 nuclei from the prefrontal cortical samples of AD patients and normal control (NC) subjects. Differential analysis shows that the cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in AD are associated with the disruption of biological processes including angiogenesis, immune activation, synaptic signaling, and myelination. Subcluster analysis reveals that compared to NC brains, AD brains contain fewer neuroprotective astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, our findings show that a subpopulation of angiogenic endothelial cells is induced in the brain in patients with AD. These angiogenic endothelial cells exhibit increased expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors (i.e., EGFL7, FLT1, and VWF) and antigen-presentation machinery (i.e., B2M and HLA-E). This suggests that these endothelial cells contribute to angiogenesis and immune response in AD pathogenesis. Thus, our comprehensive molecular profiling of brain samples from patients with AD reveals previously unknown molecular changes as well as cellular targets that potentially underlie the functional dysregulation of endothelial cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in AD, providing important insights for therapeutic development.",10.1073/pnas.2008762117,10/13/20,Prefrontal cortex,Human,,

Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk is associated with the TREM2R47H variant, which impairs ligand binding and consequently microglia responses to Aβ pathology. Here, we show that TREM2 engagement by the mAb hT2AB as surrogate ligand activates microglia in 5XFAD transgenic mice that accumulate Aβ and express either the common TREM2 variant (TREM2CV) or TREM2R47H scRNA-seq of microglia from TREM2CV-5XFAD mice treated once with control hIgG1 exposed four distinct trajectories of microglia activation leading to disease-associated (DAM), interferon-responsive (IFN-R), cycling (Cyc-M), and MHC-II expressing (MHC-II) microglia types. All of these were underrepresented in TREM2R47H-5XFAD mice, suggesting that TREM2 ligand engagement is required for microglia activation trajectories. Moreover, Cyc-M and IFN-R microglia were more abundant in female than male TREM2CV-5XFAD mice, likely due to greater Aβ load in female 5XFAD mice. A single systemic injection of hT2AB replenished Cyc-M, IFN-R, and MHC-II pools in TREM2R47H-5XFAD mice. In TREM2CV-5XFAD mice, however, hT2AB brought the representation of male Cyc-M and IFN-R microglia closer to that of females, in which these trajectories had already reached maximum capacity. Moreover, hT2AB induced shifts in gene expression patterns in all microglial pools without affecting representation. Repeated treatment with a murinized hT2AB version over 10 d increased chemokines brain content in TREM2R47H-5XFAD mice, consistent with microglia expansion. Thus, the impact of hT2AB on microglia is shaped by the extent of TREM2 endogenous ligand engagement and basal microglia activation.",10.1073/pnas.2017742118,1/19/21,Cortex,Mouse,,

With an expanded survey of brain cell types, we find that 30 of the top 45 genes that have been linked to Alzheimer's disease risk by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are expressed in the human brain vasculature, and we confirm this by immunostaining. Vascular GWAS genes map to endothelial protein transport, adaptive immune and ECM pathways. Many are microglia-specific in mice, suggesting a partial evolutionary transfer of Alzheimer's disease risk. Our work uncovers the molecular basis of the human brain vasculature, which will inform our understanding of overall brain health, disease and therapy.",10.1038/s41586-021-04369-3,3/1/22,Other/combined,Human,,

Significant differences in glial gene expression (including AD risk genes expressed in both the astrocytes [CLU, MEF2C, IQCK] and microglia [APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA]) were correlated with tissue amyloid or pTau expression.

While microglia are considered key contributors to AD pathogenesis, their contribution in the combined presence of ATN pathologies remains incompletely understood. As sensors of the brain microenvironment, microglial phenotypes and contributions are importantly defined by the pathologies in the brain, indicating the need for their analysis in preclinical models that recapitulate combined ATN pathologies, besides their role in A and T models only. Here, we report a new tau-seed model in which amyloid pathology facilitates bilateral tau propagation associated with brain atrophy, thereby recapitulating robust ATN pathology. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that ATN pathology exacerbated microglial activation towards disease-associated microglia states, with a significant upregulation of Apoe as compared to amyloid-only models (A). Importantly, Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor inhibition preferentially eliminated non-plaque-associated versus plaque associated microglia. The preferential depletion of non-plaque-associated microglia significantly attenuated tau pathology and neuronal atrophy, indicating their detrimental role during ATN progression.

We identify in this module 7 established AD risk genes (APOE, CLU, INPP5D, CD33, PLCG2, SPI1, and FCER1G) and 11 AD GWAS genes below the genome-wide significance threshold (GPC2, TREML2, SYK, GRN, SLC2A5, SAMSN1, PYDC1, HEXB, RRBP1, LYN, and BLNK), that become significantly upregulated when exposed to Aβ. Single microglia sequencing confirms that Aβ, not TAU, pathology induces marked transcriptional changes in microglia, including increased proportions of activated microglia. We conclude that genetic risk of AD functionally translates into different microglia pathway responses to Aβ pathology, placing AD genetic risk downstream of the amyloid pathway but upstream of TAU pathology.",10.15252/emmm.201910606,3/6/20,Hippocampus,Mouse,,

However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying GSAP-dependent pathogenesis remains largely elusive. Here, through unbiased proteomics and single-nuclei RNAseq, we identified that GSAP regulates multiple biological pathways, including protein phosphorylation, trafficking, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function. We demonstrated that GSAP physically interacts with the Fe65-APP complex to regulate APP trafficking/partitioning. GSAP is enriched in the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) and regulates lipid homeostasis through the amyloidogenic processing of APP. GSAP deletion generates a lipid environment unfavorable for AD pathogenesis, leading to improved mitochondrial function and the rescue of cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. Finally, we identified a novel GSAP single-nucleotide polymorphism that regulates its brain transcript level and is associated with an increased AD risk.

We identified an oligodendrocyte state that increased in association with brain pathology, which we termed disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DOLs). In a murine model of amyloidosis, DOLs appear long after plaque accumulation, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) alone was not sufficient to induce the DOL signature in vitro. DOLs could be identified in a mouse model of tauopathy and in other murine neurodegenerative and autoimmune inflammatory conditions, suggesting a common response to severe pathological conditions. Using quantitative spatial analysis of mouse and postmortem human brain tissues, we found that oligodendrocytes expressing a key DOL marker (SERPINA3N/SERPINA3 accordingly) are present in the cortex in areas of brain damage and are enriched near Aβ plaques. In postmortem human brain tissue, the expression level of this marker correlated with cognitive decline.

Overall, alterations of RNA and protein metabolism, inflammatory processes, and signal transduction were observed in multiple cell populations, suggesting their role in Alzheimer's disease-related olfactory mucosa pathophysiology. Furthermore, the single-cell RNA-sequencing proposed alterations in gene expression of mitochondrially located genes in AD OM cells, which were verified by functional assays, demonstrating altered mitochondrial respiration and a reduction of ATP production. Our results reveal disease-related changes of olfactory mucosal cells in Alzheimer's disease and demonstrate the utility of single-cell RNA sequencing data for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with the disease.",10.3390/cells11040676,2/15/22,Other/combined,Human,,

Here we report that secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1/osteopontin) is upregulated predominantly by perivascular macrophages and, to a lesser extent, by perivascular fibroblasts. Perivascular SPP1 is required for microglia to engulf synapses and upregulate phagocytic markers including C1qa, Grn and Ctsb in presence of amyloid-β oligomers. Absence of Spp1 expression in AD mouse models results in prevention of synaptic loss. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing and putative cell-cell interaction analyses reveal that perivascular SPP1 induces microglial phagocytic states in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), DNs play a crucial role in impairing neuronal communication and function, and they may also contribute to the accumulation and spread of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain of AD patients. However, it is still a challenge to understand the DNs of specific neurons that are vulnerable to Aβ in the pathogenesis of AD. To shed light on the development of radiating DNs, we examined enriched dystrophic hippocampal axons in a mouse model of AD using a three-dimensional rendering of projecting neurons. We employed the anterograde spread of adeno-associated virus (AAV)1 and conducted proteomic analysis of synaptic compartments obtained from hippocampo-septal regions. Our findings revealed that DNs were formed due to synaptic loss at the axon terminals caused by the accumulation of extracellular vesicle (EV). Abnormal EV-mediated transport and exocytosis were identified in association with primary cilia, indicating their involvement in the accumulation of EVs at presynaptic terminals. To further address the regulation of DNs by primary cilia, we conducted knockdown of the Ift88 gene in hippocampal neurons, which impaired EV-mediated secretion of Aβ and promoted accumulation of axonal spheroids. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified the septal projecting hippocampal somatostatin neurons (SOM) as selectively vulnerable to Aβ with primary cilia dysfunction and vesicle accumulation. Our study suggests that DNs in AD are initiated by the ectopic accumulation of EVs at the neuronal axon terminals, which is affected by neuronal primary cilia.",10.1186/s40478-023-01637-3,9/4/23,Hippocampus,Mouse,,

Although sex differences in microglial function and transcriptomic programming have been described across development and in disease models of AD, no studies have comprehensively identified the sex divergences that emerge in the aging mouse hippocampus. Further, existing models of AD generally develop pathology (amyloid plaques and tau tangles) early in life and fail to recapitulate the aged brain environment associated with late-onset AD. Here, we examined and compared transcriptomic and translatomic sex effects in young and old murine hippocampal microglia. Methods: Hippocampal tissue from C57BL6/N and microglial NuTRAP mice of both sexes were collected at young (5-6 month-old [mo]) and old (22-25 mo) ages. Cell sorting and affinity purification techniques were used to isolate the microglial transcriptome and translatome for RNA-sequencing and differential expression analyses. Flow cytometry, qPCR, and imaging approaches were used to confirm the transcriptomic and translatomic findings. Results: There were marginal sex differences identified in the young hippocampal microglia, with most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) restricted to the sex chromosomes. Both sex chromosomally and autosomally encoded sex differences emerged with aging. These sex DEGs identified at old age were primarily female-biased and enriched in senescent and disease-associated microglial signatures. Normalized gene expression values can be accessed through a searchable web interface ( https://neuroepigenomics.omrf.org/ ). Pathway analyses identified upstream regulators induced to a greater extent in females than in males, including inflammatory mediators IFNG, TNF, and IL1B, as well as AD-risk genes TREM2 and APP. Conclusions: These data suggest that female microglia adopt disease-associated and senescent phenotypes in the aging mouse hippocampus, even in the absence of disease pathology, to a greater extent than males. This sexually divergent microglial phenotype may explain the difference in susceptibility and disease progression in the case of AD pathology. Future studies will need to explore sex differences in microglial heterogeneity in response to AD pathology and determine how sex-specific regulators (i.e., sex chromosomal or hormonal) elicit these sex effects.",10.1186/s12974-023-02870-2,8/16/23,Hippocampus,Mouse,,

Alzheimer's research & therapy, 14(1), 158. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-022-01096-3","Background: Microglia are the resident immune cells found in our brain. They have a critical role in brain maintenance. Microglia constantly scavenge various waste materials in the brain including damaged or apoptotic neurons and Aβ. Through phagocytosis of Aβ, microglia prevent the accumulation of Aβ plaque in the brain. However, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, chronic exposure to Aβ makes microglia to become exhausted, which reduces their phagocytic activity against Aβ. Since microglia play an important role in Aβ clearance, enhancing microglial phagocytic activity against Aβ is a promising target for AD treatment. Therefore, there is a great need for therapeutic candidate that enhances microglial Aβ clearance while inhibiting microglia's pathogenic properties. Methods: In vivo studies were conducted with 5xFAD AD model mice by treating gossypetin for 13 weeks through intragastric administration. Their spatial learning and memory were evaluated through behavior tests such as Y-maze and Morris Water Maze test. Hippocampus and cortex were acquired from the sacrificed mice, and they were used for histological and biochemical analysis. Also, mouse tissues were dissociated into single cells for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Transcriptome of microglial population was analyzed. Mouse primary microglia and BV2 mouse microglial cell line were cultured and treated with fluorescent recombinant Aβ to evaluate whether their phagocytic activity is affected by gossypetin. Results: Gossypetin treatment improved the spatial learning and memory of 5xFAD by decreasing Aβ deposition in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD. Gossypetin induced transcriptomic modulations in various microglial subpopulations, including disease-associated microglia. Gossypetin enhanced phagocytic activity of microglia while decreasing their gliosis. Gossypetin also increased MHC II+ microglial population. Conclusions: Gossypetin showed protective effects against AD by enhancing microglial Aβ phagocytosis. Gossypetin appears to be a novel promising therapeutic candidate against AD.",10.1186/s13195-022-01096-3,10/21/22,Other/combined,Mouse,,

DSB-bearing neurons enter a late-stage DNA damage response marked by nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-activated senescent and antiviral immune pathways. In humans, Alzheimer's disease pathology is closely associated with immune activation in excitatory neurons. Spatial transcriptomics reveal that regions of CK-p25 brain tissue dense with DSB-bearing neurons harbor signatures of inflammatory microglia, which is ameliorated by NFκB knockdown in neurons. Inhibition of NFκB in DSB-bearing neurons also reduces microglia activation in organotypic mouse brain slice culture. In conclusion, DSBs activate immune pathways in neurons, which in turn adopt a senescence-associated secretory phenotype to elicit microglia activation.

However, the molecular mechanisms promoting pro-neurogenic astroglial fate despite AD pathology are unknown. In this study, we used APP/PS1dE9 mouse model and induced Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) expression in the hippocampus. Ngfr, which promotes neurogenic fate of astroglia during the amyloid pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish brain, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcomes. Histological analyses of the changes in proliferation and neurogenesis, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies showed that the induced expression of Ngfr reduced the reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), which we found was sufficient to reduce neurogenesis in astroglia. Anti-neurogenic effects of Lcn2 was mediated by Slc22a17, blockage of which recapitulated the pro-neurogenicity by Ngfr. Long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Postmortem human AD hippocampi and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with reactive gliosis and reduced neurogenesis. Comparing transcriptional changes in mouse, zebrafish, and human AD brains for cell intrinsic differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression networks revealed common altered downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, such as PFKP, which can enhance proliferation and neurogenesis in vitro when blocked. Our study suggests that the reactive non-neurogenic astroglia in AD can be coaxed to a pro-neurogenic fate and AD pathology can be alleviated with Ngfr.

A comprehensive investigation of cell type-specific responses and cellular heterogeneity in AD is required to provide precise molecular and cellular targets for therapeutic development. Accordingly, we perform single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of 169,496 nuclei from the prefrontal cortical samples of AD patients and normal control (NC) subjects. Differential analysis shows that the cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in AD are associated with the disruption of biological processes including angiogenesis, immune activation, synaptic signaling, and myelination. Subcluster analysis reveals that compared to NC brains, AD brains contain fewer neuroprotective astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, our findings show that a subpopulation of angiogenic endothelial cells is induced in the brain in patients with AD. These angiogenic endothelial cells exhibit increased expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors (i.e., EGFL7, FLT1, and VWF) and antigen-presentation machinery (i.e., B2M and HLA-E). This suggests that these endothelial cells contribute to angiogenesis and immune response in AD pathogenesis. Thus, our comprehensive molecular profiling of brain samples from patients with AD reveals previously unknown molecular changes as well as cellular targets that potentially underlie the functional dysregulation of endothelial cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in AD, providing important insights for therapeutic development.",10.1073/pnas.2008762117,10/13/20,Prefrontal cortex,Human,,

Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of brain tissue in Alzheimer's disease, we have identified a microglial state defined by the expression of the lipid droplet-associated enzyme ACSL1 with ACSL1-positive microglia being most abundant in patients with Alzheimer's disease having the APOE4/4 genotype. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, fibrillar Aβ induces ACSL1 expression, triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet accumulation in an APOE-dependent manner. Additionally, conditioned media from lipid droplet-containing microglia lead to Tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in an APOE-dependent manner.

Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization.

PMX205 also reduced neurotoxic astrocyte gene expression, but clusters associated with protective responses to injury were unchanged. C5aR1 inhibition promoted mRNA-predicted signaling pathways between brain cell types associated with cell growth and repair, while suppressing inflammatory pathways. Finally, although hippocampal plaque load was unaffected, PMX205 prevented deficits in short-term memory in female Arctic mice.

To gain insights into early AD-associated molecular changes and their sex dependency for tau pathology in the cortex, we performed single-cell RNA-seq in the THY-Tau22 AD mouse model. By examining cell type-specific and cell type-agnostic AD-related gene activity changes and their sex-dimorphism for individual genes, pathways and cellular sub-networks, we identified both statistically significant alterations and interpreted the upstream mechanisms controlling them. Our results confirm several significant sex-dependent alterations in gene activity in the THY-Tau22 model mice compared to controls, with more pronounced alterations in females. Both changes shared across multiple cell types and cell type-specific changes were observed. The differential genes showed significant over-representation of known AD-relevant processes, such as pathways associated with neuronal differentiation, programmed cell death and inflammatory responses. Regulatory network analysis of these genes revealed upstream regulators that modulate many of the downstream targets with sex-dependent changes. Most key regulators have been previously implicated in AD, such as Egr1, Klf4, Chchd2, complement system genes, and myelin-associated glycoproteins. Comparing with similar data from the Tg2576 AD mouse model and human AD patients, we identified multiple genes with consistent, cell type-specific and sex-dependent alterations across all three datasets.

In summary, we observed significant cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the THY-Tau22 mouse model, with a strong over-representation of known AD-associated genes and processes. These include both sex-neutral and sex-specific patterns, characterized by consistent shifts in upstream master regulators and downstream target genes. Collectively, these findings provide insights into mechanisms influencing sex-specific susceptibility to AD and reveal key regulatory proteins that could be targeted for developing treatments addressing sex-dependent AD pathology.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-01885-9,3/7/24,cortex,Mouse,"44,910",

This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice.

The majority of the vascular transcriptional changes were in pericytes. Of the vascular molecular targets predicted to interact with astrocytic ligands, SMAD3, upregulated in Alzheimer's disease pericytes, has the highest number of ligands including VEGFA, downregulated in Alzheimer's disease astrocytes. We validated these findings with external datasets comprising 4,730 pericyte and 150,664 astrocyte nuclei. Blood SMAD3 levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease-related neuroimaging outcomes. We determined inverse relationships between pericytic SMAD3 and astrocytic VEGFA in human iPSC and zebrafish models. Here, we detect vast transcriptome changes in Alzheimer's disease at the gliovascular-unit, prioritize perturbed pericytic SMAD3-astrocytic VEGFA interactions, and validate these in cross-species models to provide a molecular mechanism of blood-brain-barrier disintegrity in Alzheimer's disease.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48926-6,6/20/24,brain,Human,87493,

As BRI2 hinders α-secretase cleavage of the AD-related Aβ-Precursor-Protein, we probed whether BRI2 influences TREM2 processing.

Experimentally, Trem2 deficiency affects parenchymal amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. However, the role of TREM2 in cerebrovascular amyloidosis, especially cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), remains unexplored. Methods: Tg-SwDI (SwDI) mice, a CAA-prone model of AD, and Trem2 knockout mice were crossed to generate SwDI/TWT, SwDI/THet, and SwDI/TKO mice, followed by pathological and biochemical analyses at 16 months of age. Results: Loss of Trem2 led to a dramatic decrease in CAA and microglial association, despite a marked increase in overall brain Aβ load. Single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed that in the absence of Trem2, microglia were activated but trapped in transition to the fully reactive state, with distinct responses of vascular cells. Discussion: Our study provides the first evidence that TREM2 differentially modulates parenchymal and vascular Aβ pathologies, offering significant implications for both TREM2- and Aβ-targeting therapies for AD. Highlights: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) differentially modulates brain parenchymal and vascular amyloidosis. Loss of Trem2 markedly reduces cerebral amyloid angiopathy despite an overall increase of amyloid beta load in Tg-SwDI mice. Microglia are trapped in transition to the fully reactive state without Trem2. Perivascular macrophages and other vascular cells have distinct responses to Trem2 deficiency.

Treatment of human iPSC-derived neurons with TPPU enhanced synaptic density without affecting Tau accumulation, suggesting a cell-autonomous neuroprotective effect of sEH blockade. Furthermore, sEH inhibition reversed disease-associated and interferon-responsive microglial states in PS19 mice, while EET supplementation promoted Tau phagocytosis and clearance in primary microglia cultures.

Journal of neuroinflammation, 22(1), 119. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-025-03433-3","Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in the brain, with eventual widespread neurodegeneration. While the cell-specific molecular signature of end-stage AD is reasonably well characterized through autopsy material, less is known about the molecular pathways in the human brain involved in the earliest exposure to Aβ. Human model systems that not only replicate the pathological features of AD but also the transcriptional landscape in neurons, astrocytes and microglia are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, we used a human 3D iPSC-derived neurosphere model to explore how resident neurons, microglia and astrocytes and their interplay are modified by chronic amyloidosis induced over 3-5 weeks by supplementing media with synthetic Aβ1 - 42 oligomers. Neurospheres under chronic Aβ exposure were grown with or without microglia to investigate the functional roles of microglia. Neuronal activity and oxidative stress were monitored using genetically encoded indicators, including GCaMP6f and roGFP1, respectively. Single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed to profile Aβ and microglia driven transcriptional changes in neurons and astrocytes, providing a comprehensive analysis of cellular responses. Results: Microglia efficiently phagocytosed Aβ inside neurospheres and significantly reduced neurotoxicity, mitigating amyloidosis-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration following different exposure times to Aβ. The neuroprotective effects conferred by the presence of microglia was associated with unique gene expression profiles in astrocytes and neurons, including several known AD-associated genes such as APOE. These findings reveal how microglia can directly alter the molecular landscape of AD. Conclusions: Our human 3D neurosphere culture system with chronic Aβ exposure reveals how microglia may be essential for the cellular and transcriptional responses in AD pathogenesis. Microglia are not only neuroprotective in neurospheres but also act as key drivers of Aβ-dependent APOE expression suggesting critical roles for microglia in regulating APOE in the AD brain. This novel, well characterized, functional in vitro platform offers unique opportunities to study the roles and responses of microglia to Aβ modelling key aspects of human AD. This tool will help identify new therapeutic targets, accelerating the transition from discovery to clinical applications.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-025-03433-3,4/23/25,iPSC,Human,6570,

We develop a scalable method for discovering gene modules, which we use to identify cell-type-specific and region-specific modules that are altered in Alzheimer's disease and to annotate transcriptomic differences associated with diverse pathological variables. We identify an astrocyte program that is associated with cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's disease pathology, tying choline metabolism and polyamine biosynthesis in astrocytes to preserved cognitive function late in life.

VEGF-associated intercellular communication was also profiled.Results: Higher microglia FLT1, endothelial FLT4, and oligodendrocyte VEGFB are associated with greater amyloid beta (Aβ) load, whereas higher VEGFB expression in inhibitory neurons is associated with lower Aβ load. Higher astrocyte NRP1 is associated with lower tau density. Higher microglia and endothelial FLT1 are associated with worse cognition performance. Endothelial and microglial FLT1 expression was upregulated in clinical AD patients compared to cognitively normal controls. Finally, AD cells showed a significant reduction in VEGF signaling compared to controls.Discussion: Our results highlight key changes in VEGF receptor expression in endothelial and microglial cells during AD, and the potential protective role of VEGFB in neurons.Highlights: The prefrontal cortical expression of FLT1 and FLT4 was associated with worse cross-sectional global cognitive function, longitudinal cognitive trajectories, and more Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The associations between FLT1 or FLT4 and AD endophenotypes appear to be driven by endothelial and microglial cells. VEGFB expression seems to have opposing effects on the Aβ burden in AD depending on cell types, highlighting its potential protective role in neurons.",https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14419,2/21/25,dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,Human,participants had a median of 3824,

Targeting amyloid plaques shows modest improvement in male non-APOE4 carriers. Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics across APOE variants in both sexes, multiplex flow cytometry and validation in two independent cohorts of APOE4 female carriers with AD, we identify a new subset of neutrophils interacting with microglia associated with cognitive impairment. This phenotype is defined by increased interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-1 coexpressed gene modules in blood neutrophils and in microglia of cognitively impaired female APOE ε4 carriers, showing increased infiltration to the AD brain. APOE4 female IL-17+ neutrophils upregulated the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGFβ and immune checkpoints, including LAG3 and PD-1, associated with accelerated immune aging. Deletion of APOE4 in neutrophils reduced this immunosuppressive phenotype and restored the microglial response to neurodegeneration, limiting plaque pathology in AD mice. Mechanistically, IL-17F upregulated in APOE4 neutrophils interacts with microglial IL-17RA to suppress the induction of the neurodegenerative phenotype, and blocking this axis supported cognitive improvement in AD mice.

Due to lack of effective therapy, preventive treatments are important strategies to limit AD onset and progression, of which dietary regimes have been implicated as a key factor. Diet with high fiber content is known to have beneficial effects on cognitive decline in AD. However, a global survey on microbiome and brain cell dynamics in response to high fiber intake at single-cell resolution in AD mouse models is still missing. Results: Here, we show that dietary inulin supplementation synergized with AD progression to specifically increase the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in gut microbiome of 5 × Familial AD (FAD) mice. By performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing on different regions of the whole brain with three independent biological replicates, we reveal region-specific changes in the proportion of neuron, astrocyte, and granule cell subpopulations upon inulin supplementation in 5xFAD mice. In addition, we find that astrocytes have more pronounced region-specific diversity than microglia. Intriguingly, such dietary change reduces amyloid-β plaque burden and alleviates microgliosis in the forebrain region, without affecting the spatial learning and memory.

The key in vivo disease-driving mechanisms and how loss- and gain-of-function interplay remain poorly understood. Here, we identified dysregulation of a lysosome-ribosome biogenesis circuit as an early and key disease mechanism using a physiologically relevant mouse model with combined loss- and gain-of-function across the aging process.

Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq revealed that C9orf72 depletion disrupts lysosomes in neurons and leads to transcriptional dysregulation of ribosomal protein genes, which are likely due to the proteotoxic stress response and resemble ribosomopathy defects. Importantly, ectopic expression of C9orf72 or its partner Smcr8 in C9FTD/ALS mutant mice promotes lysosomal functions and restores ribosome biogenesis gene transcription, resulting in the mitigation of DPR accumulation, neurodegeneration as well as FTD/ALS-like motor and cognitive behaviors.

However, a decade prior to the emergence of motor issues, patients frequently experience non-motor symptoms, such as a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). The cellular and molecular bases for these early defects remain enigmatic. To explore this, we developed a new collection of five fruit fly models of familial Parkinsonism and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on young brains of these models. Interestingly, cholinergic projection neurons are the most vulnerable cells, and genes associated with presynaptic function are the most deregulated. Additional single nucleus sequencing of three specific brain regions of Parkinson's disease patients confirms these findings. Indeed, the disturbances lead to early synaptic dysfunction, notably affecting cholinergic olfactory projection neurons crucial for olfactory function in flies. Correcting these defects specifically in olfactory cholinergic interneurons in flies or inducing cholinergic signaling in Parkinson mutant human induced dopaminergic neurons in vitro using nicotine, both rescue age-dependent dopaminergic neuron decline. Hence, our research uncovers that one of the earliest indicators of disease in five different models of familial Parkinsonism is synaptic dysfunction in higher-order cholinergic projection neurons and this contributes to the development of hyposmia.

Differential infiltrated cells (DICs) were identified between PD and CON. DICs were further sub-clustered. DIC-DEGs and DE-LRGs were determined. Overlapping DIC-DEGs and DE-LRGs yielded candidate genes. CytoNCA's five algorithms screened biomarkers. Biomarker expression was compared between PD and CON. Cell-cell communication and pseudotime analyses explored communication and differentiation. In scRNA-seq, 28 distinct clusters were annotated with seven known cell types, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Among them, the DICs, oligodendrocytes, and neurons were clustered into six and seven distinct cell subclusters, respectively. Importantly, a total of 241 DIC-DEGs and 664 DEGs were identified, followed by generating 179 candidate genes. Ubb, Gapdh, Cox4i1, and Hsp90aa1 were determined as biomarkers by five algorithms. Notably, the expression levels of four biomarkers were significantly different in oligodendrocytes and neurons between the PD and CON groups. Subsequently, the pseudotime analysis found that the expression of biomarkers was higher at the end of differentiation in both oligodendrocytes and neurons. What is more, the cell crosstalk between the oligodendrocytes and neurons was high in PD and CON groups. Overall, Ubb, Gapdh, Cox4i1, and Hsp90aa1 were mined as biomarkers, and oligodendrocytes and neurons were key cells in PD patients. Our findings provided new theoretical support for PD treatment.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05014-0,6/19/25,brain,Mouse,,

Although the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is the pathological hallmark of PD, neuroinflammation also plays a fundamental role in PD pathology. We have previously reported that PD patients have increased frequencies of T cells reactive to peptides from α-synuclein (α-syn). However, not all PD participants respond to α-syn. Furthermore, we have previously found that CD4 T cells from PD participants responding to α-syn (PD_R) are transcriptionally distinct from PD participants not responding to α-syn (PD_NR). To gain further insight into the pathology of PD_R participants, we investigated surface protein expression of 11 proteins whose genes had previously been found to be differentially expressed when comparing PD_R and healthy control participants not responding to α-syn (HC_NR). We found that Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2 (CELSR2) was expressed on a significantly higher proportion of CD4 effector memory T cells (TEM) in PD_R compared to HC_NR. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of cells expressing or not expressing CELSR2 revealed that PD_R participants have elevated frequencies of activated TEM subsets and an almost complete loss of cytotoxic TEM cells. Flow cytometry analyses confirmed that Granulysin+ CD4 cytotoxic TEM cells are reduced in PD_R. Taken together, these results provide further insight into the perturbation of T cell subsets in PD_R, and highlights the need for further investigation into the role of Granulysin+ CD4 cytotoxic TEM in PD pathology.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-025-00981-6,5/14/25,PBMC ,Human,,

In the current study, we aimed to map the peripheral immunity atlas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PD patients and healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our study employed scRNA-seq analysis to map the peripheral immunity atlas in PD by profiling PBMCs from PD-Early, PD-Late patients and matched controls. By enlarging the blood sample size, we validated the roles of NK cells in numerous immune-related biological processes. We also detected the infiltration of NK cells into the cerebral motor cortex as the disease progressed, using human brain sections, and elucidated the communication between the periphery and CNS and its implications for PD. As a result, cell subpopulation atlases in PBMCs from PD patients and healthy controls along with differentially expressed genes in NK cells were identified by scRNA-seq analysis, representing 6 major immune cell subsets among which NK cells declined in the progression of PD. We further validated NK cell reduction in increasing samples and found that they participated in numerous immune-related biological processes and infiltration into the cerebral motor cortex as the disease proceeded, evidencingd the close communication between the peripheral immune response and CNS. Strikingly, XCL2 positively correlated with PD severity, with good predictive performance of PD and specific expression in subclusters C2 and C5 of NK cells. All these findings delineated the critical role of peripheral immune response mediated by NK cells in the pathogenesis of PD. NK cell-specific XCL2 could be used as a diagnostic marker for treating PD. The indispensable function of NK cells and NK cell-specific molecular biomarkers highlighted the implication of the peripheral immune response in PD progression.

Neuroinflammation specifically induced by α-synuclein has been shown to exacerbate neurodegeneration, yet the role of central nervous system (CNS) resident macrophages in this process remains unclear. We found that a specific subset of CNS resident macrophages, border-associated macrophages (BAMs), play an essential role in mediating α-synuclein related neuroinflammation due to their unique role as the antigen presenting cells necessary to initiate a CD4 T cell response whereas the loss of MHCII antigen presentation on microglia had no effect on neuroinflammation. Furthermore, α-synuclein expression led to an expansion in border-associated macrophage numbers and a unique damage-associated activation state. Through a combinatorial approach of single-cell RNA sequencing and depletion experiments, we found that border-associated macrophages played an essential role in immune cell recruitment, infiltration, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, border-associated macrophages were identified in post-mortem PD brain in close proximity to T cells.

Transcriptomic profiling can contribute to addressing this gap, but remains limited in the LBDs. Here, we applied paired bulk-tissue and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to anterior cingulate cortex samples derived from 28 individuals, including healthy controls, PD, PDD and DLB cases (n = 7 per group), to transcriptomically profile the LBDs. Using this approach, we (i) found transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types across the LBDs; (ii) discovered evidence for widespread dysregulation of RNA splicing, particularly in PDD and DLB; (iii) identified potential splicing factors, with links to other dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases, coordinating this dysregulation; and (iv) identified transcriptomic commonalities and distinctions between the LBDs that inform understanding of the relationships between these three clinical disorders.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelination in the central nervous system thus leads to neurodegeneration, but the severity of MS between patients is very variable. Disability does not correlate well with the extent of demyelination1, which suggests that other factors contribute to this variability. One such factor may be oligodendrocyte heterogeneity. Not all oligodendrocytes are the same-those from the mouse spinal cord inherently produce longer myelin sheaths than those from the cortex2, and single-cell analysis of the mouse central nervous system identified further differences3,4. However, the extent of human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity and its possible contribution to MS pathology remain unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing from white matter areas of post-mortem human brain from patients with MS and from unaffected controls. We identified subclusters of oligodendroglia in control human white matter, some with similarities to mouse, and defined new markers for these cell states. Notably, some subclusters were underrepresented in MS tissue, whereas others were more prevalent. These differences in mature oligodendrocyte subclusters may indicate different functional states of oligodendrocytes in MS lesions. We found similar changes in normal-appearing white matter, showing that MS is a more diffuse disease than its focal demyelination suggests. Our findings of an altered oligodendroglial heterogeneity in MS may be important for understanding disease progression and developing therapeutic approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0903-2,1/23/19,white matter,Human,"17,799",

We found unique OLs and OL precursor cells (OPCs) in EAE and uncovered several genes specifically alternatively spliced in these cells. Surprisingly, EAE-specific OL lineage populations expressed genes involved in antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC-I and -II), and in immunoprotection, suggesting alternative functions of these cells in a disease context. Importantly, we found that disease-specific oligodendroglia are also present in human MS brains and that a substantial number of genes known to be susceptibility genes for MS, so far mainly associated with immune cells, are expressed in the OL lineage cells. Finally, we demonstrate that OPCs can phagocytose and that MHC-II-expressing OPCs can activate memory and effector CD4-positive T cells.

Here, we investigate whether the therapeutic resistance of progressive MS can be attributed to chronic immune cell accumulation behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB).Methods: We systematically track CNS-homing immune cells in the peripheral blood of 31 MS patients and 31 matched healthy individuals in an integrated analysis of 497,705 single-cell transcriptomes and 355,433 surface protein profiles from 71 samples. Through spatial RNA sequencing, we localize these cells in post mortem brain tissue of 6 progressive MS patients contrasted against 4 control brains (20 samples, 85,000 spot transcriptomes).Findings: We identify a specific pathogenic CD161+/lymphotoxin beta (LTB)+ T cell population that resides in brains of progressive MS patients. Intriguingly, our data suggest that the colonization of the CNS by these T cells may begin earlier in the disease course, as they can be mobilized to the blood by usage of the integrin-blocking antibody natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS patients.Conclusions: As a consequence, we lay the groundwork for a therapeutic strategy to deplete CNS-homing T cells before they can fuel treatment-resistant progression.Funding: This study was supported by funding from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft, the OAK Foundation, Medical Research Council UK, and Wellcome.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2021.01.006,3/12/21,blood,Human,"497,705",

Through transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that wild-type HDAC7 regulates genes essential for the function of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), an immunosuppressive subset of CD4 T cells that is generally dysfunctional in patients with MS. Moreover, Treg-specific conditional hemizygous deletion of HDAC7 increased the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a mouse model of neuroinflammation. In contrast, Tregs transduced with the protective HDAC7 R166H variant exhibited higher suppressive capacity in an in vitro functional assay, mirroring phenotypes previously observed in patient samples. In vivo modeling of the human HDAC7 R166H variant by generation of a knock-in mouse model bearing an orthologous R150H substitution demonstrated decreased EAE severity linked to transcriptomic alterations of brain-infiltrating Tregs, as assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing.

Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. However, the role and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in activation of astrocytes have not been clarified. Here, we found that PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear import by DASA-58 significantly reduced the activation of mice primary astrocytes, which was observed by decreased proliferation, glycolysis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. TRIM21 interacted with PKM2, promoted its nuclear translocation and stimulated its nuclear activity to phosphorylate STAT3, NF-κB and interact with c-myc. Further single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was upregulated in astrocytes of EAE. TRIM21 overexpressing in mice primary astrocytes enhanced PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation, which could be reversed by DASA-58. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector to knockdown TRIM21 in astrocytes or intraperitoneal injection of TEPP-46, which inhibit the nuclear translocation of PKM2, effectively decreased disease severity, CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE.

No neuroprotective therapy is available to promote the survival of oligodendrocytes and protect their myelin processes in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. Pro-inflammatory CD4 Th17 cells can interact with oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, causing injury to myelinating processes and cell death through direct contact. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the close contact and subsequent detrimental interaction of Th17 cells with oligodendrocytes remain unclear. In this study we used single cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence studies on CNS tissue from multiple sclerosis subjects, its animal model and controls to characterize the expression of cell adhesion molecules by mature oligodendrocytes. We found that a significant proportion of human and murine mature oligodendrocytes express melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) and activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) in multiple sclerosis, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and in controls, although their regulation differs between human and mouse. We observed that exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines or to human activated T cells are associated with a marked downregulation of the expression of MCAM but not of ALCAM at the surface of human primary oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, we used in vitro live imaging, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry to determine the contribution of these molecules to Th17-polarized cell adhesion and cytotoxicity towards human oligodendrocytes. Silencing and blocking ALCAM but not MCAM limited prolonged interactions between human primary oligodendrocytes and Th17-polarized cells, resulting in decreased adhesion of Th17-polarized cells to oligodendrocytes and conferring significant protection of oligodendrocytic processes. In conclusion, we showed that human oligodendrocytes express MCAM and ALCAM, which are differently modulated by inflammation and T cell contact. We found that ALCAM is a ligand for Th17-polarized cells, contributing to their capacity to adhere and induce damage to human oligodendrocytes, and therefore could represent a relevant target for neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis.",https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad286,8/28/23,,Human,"18,000",

However, cell-intrinsic roles for miR-155 during EAE have not been formally determined. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and cell-specific conditional miR-155 KOs to determine the importance of miR-155 expression in distinct immune cell populations. Time-course single-cell sequencing revealed reductions in T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) in global miR-155 KO mice compared with wild-type controls at day 21 after EAE induction. Deletion of miR-155 in T cells, driven by CD4 Cre, significantly reduced disease severity similar to global miR-155 KOs. CD11c Cre-mediated deletion of miR-155 in DCs also resulted in a modest yet significant reduction in the development of EAE, with both T cell- and DC-specific KOs showing a reduction in Th17 T cell infiltration into the CNS. Although miR-155 is highly expressed in infiltrating macrophages during EAE, deletion of miR-155 using LysM Cre did not impact disease severity. Taken together, these data show that although miR-155 is highly expressed in most infiltrating immune cells, miR-155 has distinct roles and requirements depending on the cell type, and we have demonstrated this using the gold standard conditional KO approach.

It is becoming increasingly recognized that ependymal cells assume a reactive state in response to aging and disease, including conditions involving hypoxia, hydrocephalus, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Yet what transcriptional signatures govern these reactive states and whether this reactivity shares any similarities with classical descriptions of glial reactivity (i.e., in astrocytes) remain largely unexplored. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we interrogated this phenomenon by directly comparing the reactive ependymal cell transcriptome to the reactive astrocyte transcriptome using a well-established model of autoimmune-mediated neuroinflammation (MOG35-55 EAE). In doing so, we unveiled core glial reactivity-associated genes that defined the reactive ependymal cell and astrocyte response to MOG35-55 EAE. Interestingly, known reactive astrocyte genes from other CNS injury/disease contexts were also up-regulated by MOG35-55 EAE ependymal cells, suggesting that this state may be conserved in response to a variety of pathologies. We were also able to recapitulate features of the reactive ependymal cell state acutely using a classic neuroinflammatory cocktail (IFNγ/LPS) both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, by comparing reactive ependymal cells and astrocytes, we identified a conserved signature underlying glial reactivity that was present in several neuroinflammatory contexts.

This disease is three times more common in women, yet more severe in men, but the mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain largely unknown. MS is initiated by autoreactive T helper cells, but CNS-resident and CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells are the key proximal effector cells regulating disease pathology. We have previously shown that genetic ablation of p38α MAP kinase broadly in the myeloid lineage is protective in the autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but only in females, and not males. To precisely define the mechanisms responsible, we used multiple genetic approaches and bone marrow chimeras to ablate p38α in microglial cells, peripheral myeloid cells, or both. Deletion of p38α in both cell types recapitulated the previous sex difference, with reduced EAE severity in females. Unexpectedly, deletion of p38α in the periphery was protective in both sexes. In contrast, deletion of p38α in microglia exacerbated EAE in males only, revealing opposing roles of p38α in microglia vs. periphery. Bulk transcriptional profiling revealed that p38α regulated the expression of distinct gene modules in male vs. female microglia. Single-cell transcriptional analysis of WT and p38α-deficient microglia isolated from the inflamed CNS revealed a diversity of complex microglial states, connected by distinct convergent transcriptional trajectories. In males, microglial p38α deficiency resulted in enhanced transition from homeostatic to disease-associated microglial states, with the downregulation of regulatory genes such as Atf3, Rgs1, Socs3, and Btg2, and increased expression of inflammatory genes such as Cd74, Trem2, and MHC class I and II genes. In females, the effect of p38α deficiency was divergent, exhibiting a unique transcriptional profile that included an upregulation of tissue protective genes, and a small subset of inflammatory genes that were also upregulated in males. Taken together, these results reveal a p38α-dependent sex-specific molecular pathway in microglia that is protective in CNS autoimmunity in males, suggesting that autoimmunity in males and females is driven by distinct cellular and molecular pathways, thus suggesting design of future sex-specific therapeutic approaches.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.715311,10/11/21,spinal cord ,Mouse,"2,321",No

Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic ('phase') markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1) and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1 and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signalling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69 and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells towards persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells.

We previously demonstrated that adoptively transferred myelin-reactive CD8+ T cells (PLP-CD8) prevent EAE induction and suppress ongoing disease through the engagement of MHC Class-I in recipient mice. Here, we show that PLP-CD8 induce regulatory changes in both subsets of conventional dendritic cells (cDC1 and CD11b+ cDC) in vivo and in vitro. Adoptively transferred PLP-CD8 promoted both cDC subsets to adopt a mature and regulatory phenotype with an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile and a reduced capacity to support CD4+ T cell proliferation. In vitro, PLP-CD8 induced similar phenotypic changes in both cDC subsets in an antigen-specific, dose-dependent manner. PLP-CD8 directly interacted with cDC1 and indirectly influenced CD11b+ cDC through paracrine signaling. Notably, direct interaction with PLP-CD8 had detrimental effects on CD11b+ cDC. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of key immunoregulatory genes, such as Foxo3, in both cDC subsets with enrichment of pathways involved in immune regulation and T cell differentiation.

Results: The immune cell composition in CSF and mELT was very similar.

Methods: We here analyzed CSF and blood from two relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients early after peripheral leukocyte depletion with the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab compared to untreated RRMS and control patients using single cell RNA-sequencing. Results: As expected for alemtuzumab, most leukocyte lineages including T cells were synchronously depleted from CSF and blood, while - surprisingly - pDCs were maintained in CSF but depleted from blood by alemtuzumab. Transcriptionally, genes associated with migration were elevated only in the CSF after alemtuzumab. Predicted cellular interactions indicated a central role of pDCs and enhanced migration signaling in the CSF after alemtuzumab.Discussion: The CSF and blood compartments are thus partially uncoupled, emphasizing that the CNS is only partially accessible even for treatments profoundly affecting the blood.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2023.578088,5/15/23,CSF and blood,Human,,

The specific molecular processes allowing autoreactive immune cells to enter the CNS compartment through the blood-brain barrier remain elusive.Methods: Using endothelial cell (EC) enrichment and single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cells implicated in the neuroinflammatory processes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Validations on human MS brain sections of the most differentially expressed genes in venous ECs were performed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.Results: We found an upregulation of genes associated with antigen presentation and interferon in most populations of CNS-resident cells, including ECs. Interestingly, instead of transcriptionally distinct profiles, a continuous gradient of gene expression separated the arteriovenous zonation of the brain vasculature. However, differential gene expression analysis presented more transcriptomic alterations on the venous side of the axis, suggesting a prominent role of venous ECs in neuroinflammation. Furthermore, analysis of ligand-receptor interactions identified important potential molecular communications between venous ECs and infiltrated immune populations.

Spatial analysis of disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DAOs) in the cuprizone model reveals that DA1 and DA2 are established outside of the lesion area during demyelination and that DA1 repopulates the lesion during remyelination. Independent meta-analysis of human single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets reveals that the transcriptional responses of MS oligodendrocytes share features with mouse models.

Here, we performed in-depth characterization of meningeal versus parenchymal Th17-induced rodent neuroinflammation. The most pronounced cellular and transcriptional differences between these compartments was the localization of B cells exhibiting a follicular phenotype exclusively to the meninges. Correspondingly, meningeal but not parenchymal Th17 cells acquired a B cell-supporting phenotype and resided in close contact with B cells. This preferential B cell tropism for the meninges and the formation of meningeal ectopic lymphoid tissue was partially dependent on the expression of the transcription factor Bcl6 in Th17 cells that is required in other T cell lineages to induce isotype class switching in B cells. A function of Bcl6 in Th17 cells was only detected in vivo and was reflected by the induction of B cell-supporting cytokines, the appearance of follicular B cells in the meninges, and of immunoglobulin class switching in the cerebrospinal fluid. We thus identify the induction of a B cell-supporting meningeal microenvironment by Bcl6 in Th17 cells as a mechanism controlling compartment specificity in neuroinflammation.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2109972118,12/14/21,,Mouse,,

We hypothesize that promoting this phenotype within the post-injured cord microenvironment may provide beneficial effects for mitigating tissue damage. As a proof of concept, we propose the use of nanoparticles incorporating the carbohydrate antigen, galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal epitope) as an immunomodulator to transition human microglia (HMC3) cells toward a pro-healing state. Methods: Quiescent HMC3 cells were acutely exposed to α-gal nanoparticles in the presence of human serum and subsequently characterized for changes in cell shape, expression of anti or pro-inflammatory markers, and secretion of phenotype-specific cytokines. Results: HMC3 cells treated with serum activated α-gal nanoparticles exhibited rapid enlargement and shape change in addition to expressing CD68. Moreover, these activated cells showed increased expression of anti-inflammatory markers like Arginase-1 and CD206 without increasing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α or IL-6. Conclusion: This study is the first to show that resting human microglia exposed to a complex of α-gal nanoparticles and anti-Gal (from human serum) can be activated and polarized toward a putative M2 state. The data suggests that α-gal nanoparticles may have therapeutic relevance to the CNS microenvironment, in both recruiting and polarizing macrophages/microglia at the application site.

The key in vivo disease-driving mechanisms and how loss- and gain-of-function interplay remain poorly understood. Here, we identified dysregulation of a lysosome-ribosome biogenesis circuit as an early and key disease mechanism using a physiologically relevant mouse model with combined loss- and gain-of-function across the aging process. C9orf72 deficiency exacerbates FTD/ALS-like pathologies and behaviors in C9ORF72 bacterial artificial chromosome (C9-BAC) mice with G4C2 repeats under endogenous regulatory elements from patients. Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq revealed that C9orf72 depletion disrupts lysosomes in neurons and leads to transcriptional dysregulation of ribosomal protein genes, which are likely due to the proteotoxic stress response and resemble ribosomopathy defects. Importantly, ectopic expression of C9orf72 or its partner Smcr8 in C9FTD/ALS mutant mice promotes lysosomal functions and restores ribosome biogenesis gene transcription, resulting in the mitigation of DPR accumulation, neurodegeneration as well as FTD/ALS-like motor and cognitive behaviors.

However, heterogeneity arising from genetic and experimental variability limits their utility, impacting reproducibility and the ability to track cellular origins of pathogenesis. Here, we present methodologies using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to address these limitations. By repeatedly differentiating and applying scRNA-seq to motor neurons (MNs) from healthy, familial ALS, sporadic ALS, and genome-edited iPSC lines across multiple patients, batches, and platforms, we account for genetic and experimental variability toward identifying unified and reproducible ALS signatures. Combining HOX and developmental gene expression with global clustering, we anatomically classified cells into rostrocaudal, progenitor, and postmitotic identities. By relaxing statistical thresholds, we discovered genes in iPSC-MNs that were concordantly dysregulated in postmortem MNs and yielded predictive ALS markers in other human and mouse models. Our approach thus revealed early, convergent, and MN-resolved signatures of ALS.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2020.10.010,2/17/22,,Human iPSC ,"21,702",

In particular, elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the earliest reported marker of immune activation in HD, and this elevation has been suggested to contribute to HD pathogenesis. To test the hypothesis that IL-6 deficiency would be protective against the effects of mutant huntingtin, we generated R6/2 HD model mice that lacked IL-6. Contrary to our prediction, IL-6 deficiency exacerbated HD-model associated behavioral phenotypes. Single nuclear RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis of striatal cell types revealed that IL-6 deficiency led to the dysregulation of various genes associated with synaptic function, as well as the BDNF receptor Ntrk2. These data suggest that IL-6 deficiency exacerbates the effects of mutant huntingtin through dysregulation of genes of known relevance to HD pathobiology in striatal neurons, and further suggest that modulation of IL-6 to a level that promotes proper regulation of genes associated with synaptic function may hold promise as an HD therapeutic target.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-020-00379-3,5/24/20,striatum,Mouse,,

Although mHTT is expressed in all tissues, it significantly affects medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, resulting in their loss and the subsequent motor function impairment in HD. While HD symptoms typically emerge in midlife, disrupted MSN neurodevelopment is important. To explore the effects of mHTT on MSN development, we differentiated HD-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and isogenic controls into neuronal stem cells, and then generated a developing MSN population encompassing early, intermediate progenitors, and nascent MSNs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the developmental trajectory of MSNs in our model closely emulated the trajectory of human fetal striatal neurons. However, in the HD MSN cultures, several crucial genes required for proper MSN maturation were downregulated, including members of the DLX family of transcription factors. Our analysis also uncovered a progressive dysregulation of multiple HD-related pathways as MSNs developed, including the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.

In many forms of neurodegenerative diseases, this late-onset phenomenon remains largely unexplained. Results: Analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients, we find increased transcriptional heterogeneity in disease-state neurons. We hypothesize that transcriptional heterogeneity precedes neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To test this idea experimentally, we use juvenile forms (72Q; 180Q) of HD iPSCs, differentiate them into committed neuronal progenitors, and obtain single-cell expression profiles. We show a global increase in gene expression variability in HD. Autophagy genes become more stable, while energy and actin-related genes become more variable in the mutant cells. Knocking down several differentially variable genes results in increased aggregate formation, a pathology associated with HD. We further validate the increased transcriptional heterogeneity in CHD8+/- cells, a model for autism spectrum disorder. Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that although neurodegenerative diseases develop over time, transcriptional regulation imbalance is present already at very early developmental stages.

This study reveals for the first time a single-cell atlas of the spinal cord of mice with severe SMA, and sheds new light on the pathogenesis of SMA.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010392,9/8/22,spinal cord,Mouse,"22,155",

Cell-mediated cytotoxicity within CSF and brain parenchyma in spinal muscular atrophy unaltered by nusinersen treatment. Nature communications, 15(1), 4120. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48195-3","5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motoneuron disease caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Adaptive immunity may contribute to SMA as described in other motoneuron diseases, yet mechanisms remain elusive. Nusinersen, an antisense treatment, enhances SMN2 expression, benefiting SMA patients. Here we have longitudinally investigated SMA and nusinersen effects on local immune responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - a surrogate of central nervous system parenchyma. Single-cell transcriptomics (SMA: N = 9 versus Control: N = 9) reveal NK cell and CD8+ T cell expansions in untreated SMA CSF, exhibiting activation and degranulation markers. Spatial transcriptomics coupled with multiplex immunohistochemistry elucidate cytotoxicity near chromatolytic motoneurons (N = 4). Post-nusinersen treatment, CSF shows unaltered protein/transcriptional profiles. These findings underscore cytotoxicity's role in SMA pathogenesis and propose it as a therapeutic target. Our study illuminates cell-mediated cytotoxicity as shared features across motoneuron diseases, suggesting broader implications.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48195-3,5/15/24,CSF,Human,"22,303(control); 66,369(SMA patients)",
