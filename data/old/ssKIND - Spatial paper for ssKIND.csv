We identify unique marker genes for cortical layers and the white matter, and layer-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human AD compared to CT. Deconvolution of the Visium spots showcases the significant difference in particular cell types among cortical layers and the white matter. Gene co-expression analyses reveal eight gene modules, four of which have significantly altered co-expression patterns in the presence of AD pathology. The co-expression patterns of hub genes and enriched pathways in the presence of AD pathology indicate an important role of cell-cell-communications among microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons, which may contribute to the cellular and regional vulnerability in early AD. Using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization, we validated the cell-type-specific expression of three novel DEGs (e.g., KIF5A, PAQR6, and SLC1A3) and eleven previously reported DEGs associated with AD pathology (i.e., amyloid beta plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads) at the single cell level.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) highlighted immunometabolic changes across the APOE4 glial transcriptome, specifically in subsets of metabolically distinct microglia enriched in the E4 brain during aging or following an inflammatory challenge. E4 microglia display increased Hif1α expression and a disrupted tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and are inherently pro-glycolytic, while spatial transcriptomics and mass spectrometry imaging highlight an E4-specific response to amyloid that is characterized by widespread alterations in lipid metabolism.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), AQP4 loses its normal location and thus reduces the clearance of amyloid-β plaques and tau protein. Clinical and experimental studies showed that moxibustion can improve the learning and memory abilities of AD. To explore whether moxibustion can affect the polarization of AQP4 around the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the expression and polarization of Aqp4 in wild-type mice, APP/PS1 mice, and APP/PS1 mice intervened by moxibustion. The results showed that moxibustion improved the loss of abnormal polarization of AQP4 in APP/PS1 mice, especially in the hypothalamic BBB. Besides, the other 31 genes with Aqp4 as the core have similar depolarization in APP/PS1 mice, most of which are also membrane proteins. The majority of them have been reversed by moxibustion. At the same time, we employed the cerebrospinal fluid circulation gene set, which was found to be at a higher level in the group of APP/PS1 mice with moxibustion treatment. Finally, to further explore its mechanism, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes closely related to energy metabolism and found that moxibustion can significantly increase the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes such as Cox6a2 in the hypothalamus, which could provide energy for mRNA transport. Our research shows that increasing the polarization of hypothalamic Aqp4 through mitochondrial energy supply may be an important target for moxibustion to improve cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice.",10.3389/fnagi.2023.1069155,2/2/23,Whole Brain,,,,

Hyperphosphorylated tau emerges mainly in excitatory neurons in the CA1 region and correlates with the local enrichment of oligodendrocyte subtypes.

C-SIDE’s framework applies to many contexts: DE due to pathology, anatomical regions, cell-to-cell interactions, and cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, C-SIDE enables statistical inference across multiple /replicates. Simulations and validation experiments on Slide-seq, MERFISH, and Visium datasets demonstrate that C-SIDE accurately identifies DE with valid uncertainty quantification.

We profile the transcriptomic alterations of glial cells in the vicinity of plaques and conclude that the microglial response to plaques is consistent across different brain regions, while the astrocytic response is more heterogeneous. Meanwhile, as the microglial density of plaque niches increases, astrocytes acquire a more neurotoxic phenotype and play a key role in inducing GABAergic signaling and decreasing glutamatergic signaling in hippocampal neurons.

There also exists a positive correlation between C4b and Gad2 expression in ST indicating a potential interaction between DAA and GABAergic neurons.

Molecular Neurodegeneration, 20(1), 9.","Background: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A recent case report identified a rare variant in APOE, APOE3-R136S (Christchurch), proposed to confer resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether and how this variant exerts its protective effect. Methods: We introduced the R136S variant into mouse Apoe (ApoeCh) and investigated its effect on the development of AD-related pathology using the 5xFAD model of amyloidosis and the PS19 model of tauopathy. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis along with single-cell spatial omics and bulk proteomics to explore the impact of the ApoeCh variant on AD pathological development and the brain's response to plaques and tau. Results: In 5xFAD mice, ApoeCh enhances a Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) phenotype in microglia surrounding plaques, and reduces plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and plasma neurofilament light chain. By contrast, in PS19 mice, ApoeCh suppresses the microglial and astrocytic responses to tau-laden neurons and does not reduce tau accumulation or phosphorylation, but partially rescues tau-induced synaptic and myelin loss. We compared how microglia responses differ between the two mouse models to elucidate the distinct DAM signatures induced by ApoeCh. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation-related genes in the DAM response in a PS19 compared to a 5xFAD background, suggesting a differential response to amyloid versus tau pathology that is modulated by the presence of ApoeCh. Bulk proteomics show upregulated mitochondrial protein abundance with ApoeCh in 5xFAD mice, but reductions in mitochondrial and translation associated proteins in PS19 mice. Conclusions: These findings highlight the ability of the ApoeCh variant to modulate microglial responses based on the type of pathology, enhancing DAM reactivity in amyloid models and dampening neuroinflammation to promote protection in tau models. This suggests that the Christchurch variant's protective effects likely involve multiple mechanisms, including changes in receptor binding and microglial programming.

Here, we first performed a meta-analysis of single-nucleus transcriptomic (snRNAseq) data from 869 brains of diverse decedents, confirming the critical role of an SLC38A2 high SMTN high CACNA1D high astrocyte subset, Astrocyte 10 (Ast10), in AD and aging-related cognitive decline. We then investigated the signaling drivers of Ast10's emergence in the aging brain, focusing on interactions among microglial and astrocytic subsets. Analysis of the snRNAseq data prioritized a set of ligands and receptors that are robustly predictive of Ast10 proportions across participants, and we confirm our predictions in multiple studies. Independent validation with spatial transcriptomics reveals striking colocalization of these prioritized ligands with the Ast10 signature in AD brain tissue, but not with other astrocytic states. Genetic ablation of a top receptor PLXNB1 in murine and human iPSC-derived astrocytes decreased the Ast10 signature, confirming its regulatory role. Finally, we find that Ast10 may contribute to cognitive decline through synaptic loss and is associated with cognitive decline independent of AD.

In parallel, studies using singlecell profiling techniques have begun to cluster DA neurons into subtypes based on their molecular signatures. Recent work has shown that molecularly defined DA subtypes within the substantia nigra (SNc) display distinctive anatomic and functional properties, and differential vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on these provocative results, a granular understanding of these putative subtypes and their alterations in PD models, is imperative. We developed an optimized pipeline for single-nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and generated a high-resolution hierarchically organized map revealing 20 molecularly distinct DA neuron subtypes belonging to three main families. We integrated this data with spatial MERFISH technology to map, with high definition, the location of these subtypes in the mouse midbrain, revealing heterogeneity even within neuroanatomical sub-structures. Finally, we demonstrate that in the preclinical LRRK2G2019S knock-in mouse model of PD, subtype organization and proportions are preserved.

Therefore, we generated a MPTP-induced PD mouse model and performed spatial transcriptomic sequencing to provide more insight into the process of PD development at specific brain regions. Our results indicate that the pathological changes of PD are mainly manifested in the midbrain, especially in the substantia nigra region, with significant reductions in oligodendrocytes and Agt-labeled astrocytes and an increase in Gfap-labeled astrocytes. Macrophages displayed an increasing trend in the PD environment, indicating a pattern of immune modulation induced by PD. Moreover, pathway analysis revealed significant impairments in ion migration ability, abnormal Ca2+ channels, cAMP signaling, and synaptic damage in PD. Significant downregulation of Mt1 and Mt2 and upregulation of Atp1b2, Gpi1, and Cox6a1 in PD further underscored the occurrence of intense inflammation and immune alterations. On the basis of these findings, we have validated the significant accumulation of Ca2+ in the midbrain tissue in the PD environment by measuring its content. Additionally, we have demonstrated a close association between the reduction of dopaminergic neurons, represented by the midbrain region, and ferroptosis by evaluating the iron content, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the protein expression of GPX4 and TH in the tissue. We propose the hypothesis that PD-related inflammation and immune changes can induce neuronal and oligodendrocyte damage through the induction of ferroptosis, thereby further accelerating the progression of PD.",10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.111076,15-10-2024,"Cortex, striatum, etc.",no,no,,

Recent studies have shown that oligodendrocytes also exhibit functional abnormalities in the brains of PD patients and are involved in the ferroptotic process. However, it remains unclear whether there is an interaction between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and how they induce neuronal ferroptosis. Here, we employed single-nucleus sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to characterize the intercellular communication network between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the PD environment. Among these, astrocytes are the primary recipients of signals sent by oligodendrocytes in the FGF (Fibroblast growth factors) signaling pathway. In PD, the communication intensity is weakened, involving FGF1 and FGF9 and their receptors FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. Subsequently, we further validated the significant activation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation processes within oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in PD mice, and that astrocytes might also involve the interaction of Mt1 and Ca2+. Additionally, we demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of DA neurons in the SN region and a notable activation of ferroptosis, alongside a significant decrease in the antioxidant pathway NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4. In summary, our data elucidate that ferroptosis in the midbrain SN region preferentially occurs in astrocytes under the dysregulation of oligodendrocytes, leading to ferroptosis in DA neurons.

Glial cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, and satellite glial cells and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. Despite the greater understanding of glial cell types and functional heterogeneity achieved through single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing in animal models, few studies have investigated the transcriptomic profiles of glial cells in the human spinal cord. Here, we used high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to map the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the human spinal cord. To explore the conservation and divergence across species, we compared these findings with those from mice. In the human spinal cord, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were each divided into six distinct transcriptomic subclusters. In the mouse spinal cord, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were divided into five, four, and five distinct transcriptomic subclusters, respectively. The comparative results revealed substantial heterogeneity in all glial cell types between humans and mice. Additionally, we detected sex differences in gene expression in human spinal cord glial cells. Specifically, in all astrocyte subtypes, the levels of NEAT1 and CHI3L1 were higher in males than in females, whereas the levels of CST3 were lower in males than in females. In all microglial subtypes, all differentially expressed genes were located on the sex chromosomes. In addition to sex-specific gene differences, the levels of MT-ND4 , MT2A , MT-ATP6 , MT-CO3 , MT-ND2 , MT-ND3 , and MT-CO2 in all spinal cord oligodendrocyte subtypes were higher in females than in males. Collectively, the present dataset extensively characterizes glial cell heterogeneity and offers a valuable resource for exploring the cellular basis of spinal cord-related illnesses, including chronic pain, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.",10.4103/NRR.NRR-D-23-01876,1/11/25,Adult and developing spinal cord,no,No,,

Neuron.","Huntington's disease (HD) is marked by widespread cellular dysregulation. To understand disease mechanisms, we and others have utilized bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, which provide cell-type information but limited spatial information. We used 10× Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics integrated with matched single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) in the rapidly progressing HD R6/2 mouse brain (post-natal day 0 [P0], 4 weeks, and 12 weeks). Our data suggest regional, temporal, and cell-type-specific regulatory pathways that establish distinct gene expression changes. Synaptic dysfunction is observed broadly throughout the brain, whereas we observed early dysregulation of the transcription factor 4 (Tcf4) that may drive cortical changes. Mitochondrial deficits are the earliest changes, beginning at P0 in the striatum. Striatal identity genes show early increased expression that becomes progressively downregulated. Finally, we identified a time-dependent dysregulation of neuropeptide Y signaling and potential interaction with the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway, which may be involved in the imbalance between Drd1 and Drd2 neuron vulnerability.",10.1016/j.neuron.2025.05.014,2/6/25,"Whole brain (striatum, cortex, etc.)",no,yes,HD006,6

(2023). Human disease-specific cell signatures in non-lesional tissue in Multiple Sclerosis detected by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. bioRxiv.","Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called ""normal-appearing"" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes.",10.1101/2023.12.20.572491,20-12-2023,Non-lesional brain tissue,no,No,,

Drug development to prevent disease progression is an urgent clinical need yet is constrained by an incomplete understanding of its complex pathogenesis. Using spatial transcriptomics and proteomics on fresh-frozen human MS brain tissue, we identified multicellular mechanisms of progressive MS pathogenesis and traced their origin in relation to spatially distributed stages of neurodegeneration. By resolving ligand-receptor interactions in local microenvironments, we discovered defunct trophic and anti-inflammatory intercellular communications within areas of early neuronal decline. Proteins associated with neuronal damage in patient samples showed mechanistic concordance with published in vivo knockdown and central nervous system (CNS) disease models, supporting their causal role and value as potential therapeutic targets in progressive MS. Our findings provide a new framework for drug development strategies, rooted in an understanding of the complex cellular and signaling dynamics in human diseased tissue that facilitate this debilitating disease.",10.1038/s41593-022-01097-3,1/7/22,Multiple brain regions (lesions),no,No,,

Meningeal inflammation is a recognized risk factor for cortical gray matter pathology which can result in disabling symptoms such as cognitive impairment and depression, but the mechanisms linking meningeal inflammation and gray matter pathology remain unclear. Here, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided spatial transcriptomics in a mouse model of autoimmune meningeal inflammation to characterize the transcriptional signature in areas of meningeal inflammation and the underlying brain parenchyma. We found broadly increased activity of inflammatory signaling pathways at sites of meningeal inflammation, but only a subset of these pathways active in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Subclustering of regions adjacent to meningeal inflammation revealed the subset of immune programs induced in brain parenchyma, notably complement signaling and antigen processing/presentation. Trajectory gene and gene set modeling analysis confirmed variable penetration of immune signatures originating from meningeal inflammation into the adjacent brain tissue. This work contributes a valuable data resource to the field, provides the first detailed spatial transcriptomic characterization in a model of meningeal inflammation, and highlights several candidate pathways in the pathogenesis of gray matter pathology.",10.7554/eLife.88414,30-10-2024,Meninges + adjacent parenchyma,no,No,,

However, existing ST platforms suffer from high costs, long turnaround times, low resolution, limited gene coverage, and small tissue capture areas, which hinder their broad applications. Here we present iSCALE, a method that predicts super-resolution gene expression and automatically annotates cellular-level tissue architecture for large-sized tissues that exceed the capture areas of standard ST platforms. The accuracy of iSCALE were validated by comprehensive evaluations, involving benchmarking experiments, immunohistochemistry staining, and manual annotation by pathologists. When applied to multiple sclerosis human brain samples, iSCALE uncovered lesion associated cellular characteristics that were undetectable by conventional ST experiments. Our results demonstrate iSCALE's utility in analyzing large-sized tissues with automatic and unbiased tissue annotation, inferring cell type composition, and pinpointing regions of interest for features not discernible through human visual assessment.",10.1101/2025.02.25.640190,1/3/25,Large brain slices (coronal brain sections),no,No,,
