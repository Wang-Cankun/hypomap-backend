In Alzheimer's disease (AD), AQP4 loses its normal location and thus reduces the clearance of amyloid-β plaques and tau protein. Clinical and experimental studies showed that moxibustion can improve the learning and memory abilities of AD. To explore whether moxibustion can affect the polarization of AQP4 around the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the expression and polarization of Aqp4 in wild-type mice, APP/PS1 mice, and APP/PS1 mice intervened by moxibustion. The results showed that moxibustion improved the loss of abnormal polarization of AQP4 in APP/PS1 mice, especially in the hypothalamic BBB. Besides, the other 31 genes with Aqp4 as the core have similar depolarization in APP/PS1 mice, most of which are also membrane proteins. The majority of them have been reversed by moxibustion. At the same time, we employed the cerebrospinal fluid circulation gene set, which was found to be at a higher level in the group of APP/PS1 mice with moxibustion treatment. Finally, to further explore its mechanism, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes closely related to energy metabolism and found that moxibustion can significantly increase the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes such as Cox6a2 in the hypothalamus, which could provide energy for mRNA transport. Our research shows that increasing the polarization of hypothalamic Aqp4 through mitochondrial energy supply may be an important target for moxibustion to improve cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice.",10.3389/fnagi.2023.1069155,2/2/23,Whole Brain,,,,H&E

As proof of principle, we analyze brain tissues of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease at 8 and 13 months of age. Our approach provides a comprehensive cellular map of disease progression. It reveals a core-shell structure where disease-associated microglia (DAM) closely contact amyloid-β plaques, whereas disease-associated astrocyte-like (DAA-like) cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are enriched in the outer shells surrounding the plaque-DAM complex. Hyperphosphorylated tau emerges mainly in excitatory neurons in the CA1 region and correlates with the local enrichment of oligodendrocyte subtypes.

Here, we introduce a statistical method, Cell type-Specific Inference of Differential Expression (C-SIDE), that identifies cell type-specific DE in spatial transcriptomics, accounting for localization of other cell types. We model gene expression as an additive mixture across cell types of log-linear cell type-specific expression functions. C-SIDE’s framework applies to many contexts: DE due to pathology, anatomical regions, cell-to-cell interactions, and cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, C-SIDE enables statistical inference across multiple /replicates. Simulations and validation experiments on Slide-seq, MERFISH, and Visium datasets demonstrate that C-SIDE accurately identifies DE with valid uncertainty quantification. Lastly, we apply C-SIDE to identify plaque-dependent immune activity in Alzheimer’s disease and cellular interactions between tumor and immune cells.

Here we utilize the 10 × Visium platform to define the spatial transcriptomic profile in both AD and control (CT) MTG. We identify unique marker genes for cortical layers and the white matter, and layer-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human AD compared to CT. Deconvolution of the Visium spots showcases the significant difference in particular cell types among cortical layers and the white matter. Gene co-expression analyses reveal eight gene modules, four of which have significantly altered co-expression patterns in the presence of AD pathology. The co-expression patterns of hub genes and enriched pathways in the presence of AD pathology indicate an important role of cell-cell-communications among microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons, which may contribute to the cellular and regional vulnerability in early AD. Using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization, we validated the cell-type-specific expression of three novel DEGs (e.g., KIF5A, PAQR6, and SLC1A3) and eleven previously reported DEGs associated with AD pathology (i.e., amyloid beta plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads) at the single cell level.

We discover heterogeneity in the cellular composition of plaque niches, marked by an increase in microglial accumulation. We profile the transcriptomic alterations of glial cells in the vicinity of plaques and conclude that the microglial response to plaques is consistent across different brain regions, while the astrocytic response is more heterogeneous. Meanwhile, as the microglial density of plaque niches increases, astrocytes acquire a more neurotoxic phenotype and play a key role in inducing GABAergic signaling and decreasing glutamatergic signaling in hippocampal neurons. We thus show that the accumulation of microglia around hippocampal plaques disrupts astrocytic signaling, in turn inducing an imbalance in neuronal synaptic signaling.",10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114216,6/25/24,Whole brain (coronal sections; hippocampus and cortex with plaques),no treatment,No,,Not H&E

Molecular Neurodegeneration, 20(1), 9.","Background: Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A recent case report identified a rare variant in APOE, APOE3-R136S (Christchurch), proposed to confer resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether and how this variant exerts its protective effect. Methods: We introduced the R136S variant into mouse Apoe (ApoeCh) and investigated its effect on the development of AD-related pathology using the 5xFAD model of amyloidosis and the PS19 model of tauopathy. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis along with single-cell spatial omics and bulk proteomics to explore the impact of the ApoeCh variant on AD pathological development and the brain's response to plaques and tau. Results: In 5xFAD mice, ApoeCh enhances a Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) phenotype in microglia surrounding plaques, and reduces plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and plasma neurofilament light chain. By contrast, in PS19 mice, ApoeCh suppresses the microglial and astrocytic responses to tau-laden neurons and does not reduce tau accumulation or phosphorylation, but partially rescues tau-induced synaptic and myelin loss. We compared how microglia responses differ between the two mouse models to elucidate the distinct DAM signatures induced by ApoeCh. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation-related genes in the DAM response in a PS19 compared to a 5xFAD background, suggesting a differential response to amyloid versus tau pathology that is modulated by the presence of ApoeCh. Bulk proteomics show upregulated mitochondrial protein abundance with ApoeCh in 5xFAD mice, but reductions in mitochondrial and translation associated proteins in PS19 mice. Conclusions: These findings highlight the ability of the ApoeCh variant to modulate microglial responses based on the type of pathology, enhancing DAM reactivity in amyloid models and dampening neuroinflammation to promote protection in tau models. This suggests that the Christchurch variant's protective effects likely involve multiple mechanisms, including changes in receptor binding and microglial programming.

We profiled a total of ~ 200.000 oligodendroglial nuclei, defining 15 subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, 4 of which are disease-associated. These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat shock proteins, as well as distinct expression signatures related to immune responses, myelination alterations, and disrupted cell signaling pathways. We have also identified impairments in cell communication and oligodendrocyte development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and cell adhesion molecules. In addition, we observed significant disruptions in oligodendrocyte development, with aberrant differentiation trajectories and shifts in cell proportions, particularly in the transition from mature oligodendrocytes to disease-associated states. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased myelin levels in the PD striatum, which correlated with transcriptomic alterations. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics mapping revealed the distinct localization of disease-associated populations within the striatum, with evidence of impaired myelin integrity. Thus, we uncover oligodendroglia as a critical cell type in PD and a potential new therapeutic target for myelin-based interventions.",10.1007/s00401-025-02884-5,5/5/25,Dorsal striatum,no,No,,DAPI&GFAP

In parallel, studies using singlecell profiling techniques have begun to cluster DA neurons into subtypes based on their molecular signatures. Recent work has shown that molecularly defined DA subtypes within the substantia nigra (SNc) display distinctive anatomic and functional properties, and differential vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on these provocative results, a granular understanding of these putative subtypes and their alterations in PD models, is imperative. We developed an optimized pipeline for single-nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and generated a high-resolution hierarchically organized map revealing 20 molecularly distinct DA neuron subtypes belonging to three main families. We integrated this data with spatial MERFISH technology to map, with high definition, the location of these subtypes in the mouse midbrain, revealing heterogeneity even within neuroanatomical sub-structures. Finally, we demonstrate that in the preclinical LRRK2G2019S knock-in mouse model of PD, subtype organization and proportions are preserved. Transcriptional alterations occur in many subtypes including those localized to the ventral tier SNc, where differential expression is observed in synaptic pathways, which might account for previously described DA release deficits in this model.

Recent work has established the molecular identity of dopaminergic neurons susceptible to death, but little is known about cortical neurons susceptible to Lewy pathology or molecular changes induced by aggregates. In the current study, we use spatial transcriptomics to capture whole transcriptome signatures from cortical neurons with α-synuclein pathology compared to neurons without pathology. We find, both in PD and related PD dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and in the pre-formed fibril α-synucleinopathy mouse model, that specific classes of excitatory neurons are vulnerable to developing Lewy pathology. Further, we identify conserved gene expression changes in aggregate-bearing neurons that we designate the Lewy-associated molecular dysfunction from aggregates (LAMDA) signature. Neurons with aggregates downregulate synaptic, mitochondrial, ubiquitin-proteasome, endo-lysosomal, and cytoskeletal genes and upregulate DNA repair and complement/cytokine genes.

To better understand how altered innervation interferes with muscle homeostasis during disease progression, we generated a spatial transcriptomics dataset of skeletal muscle in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. Using this strategy, we identified polyamine metabolism as one of the main altered pathways in affected muscle fibers. By establishing a correlation between the vulnerability of muscle fibers and the dysregulation of this metabolic pathway, we show that disrupting polyamine homeostasis causes impairments similar to those seen in ALS muscle. Finally, we show that restoration of polyamine homeostasis rescues the muscle phenotype in SOD1G93A mice, opening new perspectives for the treatment of ALS.",10.1016/j.celrep.2024.115123,1/28/25,Spinal cord,yes,no,,fluorescence

As proof of principle, we analyze brain tissues of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease at 8 and 13 months of age. Our approach provides a comprehensive cellular map of disease progression. It reveals a core-shell structure where disease-associated microglia (DAM) closely contact amyloid-β plaques, whereas disease-associated astrocyte-like (DAA-like) cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are enriched in the outer shells surrounding the plaque-DAM complex. Hyperphosphorylated tau emerges mainly in excitatory neurons in the CA1 region and correlates with the local enrichment of oligodendrocyte subtypes.

Here, we characterize DSB-bearing neurons from the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration using single-nucleus, bulk, and spatial transcriptomic techniques. DSB-bearing neurons enter a late-stage DNA damage response marked by nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-activated senescent and antiviral immune pathways. In humans, Alzheimer's disease pathology is closely associated with immune activation in excitatory neurons. Spatial transcriptomics reveal that regions of CK-p25 brain tissue dense with DSB-bearing neurons harbor signatures of inflammatory microglia, which is ameliorated by NFκB knockdown in neurons. Inhibition of NFκB in DSB-bearing neurons also reduces microglia activation in organotypic mouse brain slice culture. In conclusion, DSBs activate immune pathways in neurons, which in turn adopt a senescence-associated secretory phenotype to elicit microglia activation.

Here, we first performed a meta-analysis of single-nucleus transcriptomic (snRNAseq) data from 869 brains of diverse decedents, confirming the critical role of an SLC38A2 high SMTN high CACNA1D high astrocyte subset, Astrocyte 10 (Ast10), in AD and aging-related cognitive decline. We then investigated the signaling drivers of Ast10's emergence in the aging brain, focusing on interactions among microglial and astrocytic subsets. Analysis of the snRNAseq data prioritized a set of ligands and receptors that are robustly predictive of Ast10 proportions across participants, and we confirm our predictions in multiple studies. Independent validation with spatial transcriptomics reveals striking colocalization of these prioritized ligands with the Ast10 signature in AD brain tissue, but not with other astrocytic states. Genetic ablation of a top receptor PLXNB1 in murine and human iPSC-derived astrocytes decreased the Ast10 signature, confirming its regulatory role. Finally, we find that Ast10 may contribute to cognitive decline through synaptic loss and is associated with cognitive decline independent of AD.
